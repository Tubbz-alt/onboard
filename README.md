# Onboard

This project is forked from [onboard](https://launchpad.net/onboard). It adds a DeepinTouch layout which is based on the originally shipped Small layout to provide better touchscreen support. In this layout, we replaced left-Ctrl, left-Win and left-Alt with Hide, Move and IM which are more oftenly used on touchscreens.

The IM switch button now works only with fcitx and can only support switching between en and sogoupinyin input method.

For the orignal docs, see [README](README).
